<h4>List of the Impacts (environmental, economic, social) of the Zebra Mussel </h4>
<ul>
	<li> Zebra mussels often open up during certain seasons, causing their sharp shells to be exposed to human feet </li>
	<li> A zebra mussel's primary skill is filtering water: "An adult zebra mussel filters up to a quart of water per day, which multiplied by millions of mussels means that the mussels may be filtering all the water in a lake or stream in a day." (Source: the National Atlas of the United States)
		Due to this, two things happen. 
		A "dramatic increase in water clarity in infested lakes and rivers" (Source: the National Atlas of the United States) and, 
		because it filters the water, the mussels begin to contain a disturbing amount of toxins and other harmful chemicals that can be dangerous to humans and the environment.</li>
	<li> Zebra mussels can cause water shortages because of the amount of water they absorb. 
	   "In 1989, the town of Monroe, MI lost its water supply for three days due to massive numbers of zebra mussels clogging the city's water-intake pipeline." (Source: USGS) 
	   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says "the potential economic impact to be in the billions of dollars over the next ten years" (Source: US Fish and Wildlife Service) </li>
	<li> Unfortunately for clams, zebra mussels have caused the extinction of them in many areas. 
	"Zebra mussels attach and build colonies on the clams, reducing their ability to move, feed, and breed, eventually leading to the death of the clams within a couple of years." (Source: USGS) </li>
	<li> A positive effect that zebra mussels have is that certain birds like to consume adult zebra mussels, which is beneficial from an ecological standpoint. </li>
	</ul>
<h4> Prevention and Eradication Methods </h4>
<p> The actual eradication of a colony of zebra mussels would prove very difficult, for they are quite resilient and immune to strong, poisonous chemicals. 
To completely destroy a large group would mean scraping each one off one at a time with some sort of metal implement or tool.
However, preventing the spread is not as difficult as one might think.
If people take preventitive measures, such as checking boats, vegetations, and nets, then the spread of these invasive pests can be contained with ease. 
Interestingly enough, zebra mussels often attach all over scuba divers, so if you've been scuba diving in a zebra mussel infested area, you probably want to check your equipment quite thoroughly.
Other than those simple practices, there aren't really any serious government programs towards the eradication of the zebra mussel from the US.

<h4> Zebra Mussel: The Successful Invader </h4>
<p>
Just why are zebra mussels such successful invaders? Well first there is the arguement on the biological level; zebra mussels are just more resilient to chemicals then other species.
Also, they breed fast and strong, easily wiping out species such as clams.
As well as that, they are actually quite useful to some environments; they provide use as food for birds, as well as filtering the water.
So they do provide some positive benefits, which make a lot of people overlook them. Which enables them to be the perfect invader.
